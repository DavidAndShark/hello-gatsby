Install the Gatsby CLI globally with this command:

You must install the Gatsby CLI globally! Ensure you have used the `-g` flag.

When you install Gatsby and run it for the first time, youâ€™ll see a short message notifying you about anonymous usage data that is being collected for Gatsby commands, you can read more about how that data is pulled out and used in the [telemetry doc](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/telemetry/). You can also opt out by using the `gatsby telemetry --disable` command.

Access the available commands you can give Gatsby by running the `gastby -h` command.
